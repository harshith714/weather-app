A simple weather app based on Node that returns the weather of the location given. Since this is a nodeJS program, you need to install npm and other directories required to run nodeJS programs.

How to install and run:

Clone the repo into a folder on your PC.
Open terminal and move into the folder you cloned the app.(cd /weather-app-node/weather-app).
Type 'npm install' in terminal. This installs all required directories.
Your program is ready.To get the weather of your city, type 'node app.js XXXXX' where XXXXX is the city name.
